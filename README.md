# Music_Generation_Project_MIT_DL_Lab1_2
his project is a part of MIT 6.S191 Introduction to Deep Learning course. In this project, I explored building a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for music generation. I trained a model to learn the patterns in raw sheet music in ABC notation and then use this model to generate new music.
